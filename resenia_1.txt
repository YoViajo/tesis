Still a Paradise in Santa Cruz
"This is a resort I regularly visit because of their butterfly park and aviary. The gardens are awesome and give you a glimpse of native South American forests, so the vegetation is rather exotic as well. There are plenty of orchids, bromeliad and several sorts of ferns which altogether make up a magic atmosphere.

The park itself has several pools, which comprise a day club with a SPA, a couple of bars and a gourmet restaurant. The food is awesome and unfortunately for me ( who needs to lose some 60 pounds) the portions are also rather generous.

There are also several cabins and a hotel. I stayed on Cabin 02 which is for two persons, and it is near the reception. The decoration is well made and the paintings are all signed by the Author.

The original theme of the park was the human mind, thus there is a very well made museum of natural history, called the "Evolusseum" which is equipped with a multimedia and english guiding system.

Users can also play sports ( soccer and volleyball ) or ride a train ( or whatever that vehicle came from or even horses.

The days spent in Guembe were urgently needed after this horrendous year, and I thank with my hearth the staff for always being there for me."
